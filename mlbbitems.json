It can enhance their burst damage and mobility, especially for mage assassins like Gusion, Karina and Selena. It can also synergize well with other items that have similar effects, such as Shadow Twinblades and Endless Battle.\n\nCalamity Reaper can be used to quickly clear minion waves, jungle monsters and objectives by using a skill and then following up with a basic attack. It can also be used to harass enemies in lane or team fights by poking them with skills and basic attacks. The true damage can bypass any magic resistance or shields that the enemies have.\n\nHowever, Calamity Reaper also has some drawbacks. It requires the user to be close enough to the enemy to land their basic attack, which can expose them to danger or crowd control. It also has a relatively high cost and low mana regen compared to other magic items. Therefore, it is not recommended for heroes who need more sustain or survivability in fights.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCalamity Reaper is a powerful item that can boost the damage and mobility of magic heroes who use their basic attacks frequently. It is best suited for mage assassins who can quickly execute their targets with skills and basic attacks.

Reincarnate activates when Time reaches the maximum stacks, granting the user an extra 5% magic power and 300 mana.\n\n## Usage\n\nClock of Destiny is a suitable item for magic heroes who need more durability and scaling damage in the late game. It can boost their survivability and mana pool, as well as their magic power over time. It can also synergize well with other items that benefit from high magic power or mana, such as Lightning Truncheon, Holy Crystal and Ice Queen Wand.\n\nClock of Destiny can be used to make the user more tanky and harder to kill in fights, especially for heroes who have shields or healing abilities such as Alice, Esmeralda and Cecilion. It can also be used to increase the user's damage output as the game progresses, especially for heroes who have high burst or poke potential such as Lunox, Kagura and Selena.\n\nHowever, Clock of Destiny also has some drawbacks. It requires the user to wait for a long time before reaching its full potential, which can make them weaker in the early game. It also does not provide any cooldown reduction or spell vamp, which are important stats for many magic heroes. Therefore, it is not recommended for heroes who need more utility or sustain in fights.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClock of Destiny is a powerful item that can increase the durability and damage of magic heroes who scale well into the late game. It is best suited for heroes who can survive long enough to stack up their magic power and mana. However, it also has some risks and limitations that should be considered before buying it.\n"}},"defend":{},"movement":{"arcaneboots":{"image":"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgukNML-zRLmG2UZemSASZKqbkOOjZcGhxDQot7Hs65fAcszPTeJ3MHr9wbmgoyxDIdOP3RtrMooJ-umS3rtKtYEemWlJJHStRxBJjWqqCOaB22nXR_OS0PI8Rjma9sdawpy_9RjTMnNZAagC6llZXokYD-kGR9Oa_AiDCjtW9I7OzrAa1Cny8W1NOebw/s3840/arcane-boots-png-min.png","name":"Arcane Boots","description":"\n# Arcane Boots\n\nArcane Boots is a movement item that provides the following benefits:\n\n- +15 magic penetration\n- +40 movement speed\n\nIt costs 690 gold and can be built from Boots.\n\n## Passive Effect\n\nArcane Boots has no passive effect, but it has a unique attribute that grants the user +15 magic penetration.
